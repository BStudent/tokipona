\begin{table*}[h!]

\caption{POS tags incident and chosen.
            The official dictionary often relates one token
            to more than one POS tag.
            For the current version of the text highlighting plugin described in
            Section~\ref{shigh}, for example,
            a token needs to have an established tag to have
            a defined color.
            On the 'Chosen' column, the tokens were regarded only once
            by choosing the class in the dictionary respecting the
            precedence order: PRE-VERB, VERB, PREPOSITION, PARTICLE, ADJECTIVE, NOUN, NUMBER.}\label{foobar}
\begin{tabular}{ l | c c }
POS & All  & Chosen \\\hline
NOUN & 58  & 49 \\
ADJECTIVE & 40  & 34 \\
VERB & 15  & 13 \\
PARTICLE & 12  & 12 \\
PRE-VERB & 6  & 6 \\
PREPOSITION & 5  & 5 \\
NUMBER & 4  & 1 \\\hline
total & 140  & 120 \\
